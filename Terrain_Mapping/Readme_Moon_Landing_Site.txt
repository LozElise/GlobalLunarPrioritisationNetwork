Category: Our Moon
Challenge: Eeny, Meeny, Miney, Sample!
Description: THE CHALLENGE
You are the astronaut/robotic mission lead tasked with bringing valuable specimens from the Moon back to Earth for further study. 
How will you evaluate lunar samples quickly and effectively before or while still on the mission? 
How will you differentiate samples of potential scientific value from less interesting material?

The given MATLAB code is a small part of the overall solution,

The data used for terrain mapping is from M3 camera of Chandrayana-1 (NASA Repository).
The data resolution is 100x100. 

We have tried to get the optimal landing site in the simple code given, 
Since the resolution of data is low, finding an optimal path for mining is cumbersome.
